# Project 1 - First Django App

This project will be completed in three distinct parts.  Each part will be graded
so that any problems can be fixed before they compound into larger problems.

* [Project 1 - First Django App](01)
    * [1a - Create a Github repository](01a) - Due Mon, Aug 23
    * [1b - Install Development Tools](01b) - Due Wed, Aug 25
    * [1c - Build First Application](01c) - Due Fri, Aug 27

## Project 1a - Create a Github repository - Due Mon, Aug 23

**Goal:**
Setup a git repository stored at Github that will be used for all the code you
will write for BACS 350.   All grading will be done by examining the code in this
course repo.


### Step 1 - Register for a Github account

* Visit [Github.com](https://github.com)
* Select a name that will be your permanent Github user name
* Sign up for a free account at Github
* Login to your account


### Step 2 - Create a Git Repo

* Use the Github website to create code repositories for each project
* Create a git repository for this class

* Build a repo named **BACS350**
* Example:  
    * User:  **Mark-Seaman**
    * Github URL: **https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350**
* Use a .gitignore file for **"Python"**

### Step 3 - Test .gitignore

* Visit your Github repo - mine is 
[https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350/blob/main/.gitignore](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350/blob/main/.gitignore)
* Make sure that the file has lots of content to avoid adding Python temp files
to the Git repo.


### Step 4 - Login to Sensei

* Register your name on the [Sensei Web Server](https://shrinking-world.com/course/bacs350/register)
* Fill out the form with you info
* This will let you log into Sensei


### Step 5 - Register Your Github Repo

* Setup your Github repo for Sensei to find your code

### Step 6 - Clone Your Git Repo

* Run a terminal window
* If you are missing git install it from 
<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git Downloads</a>
* Clone your Github repo to copy it to your local computer

    $ cd

    $ git clone https://github.com/<your-name>/BACS350.git

* View the files in your computer


### Step 7 - Add Screen Shot of Your Files

* Go to the directory where your Git repo is on your computer (not the Github 
website).
* Do a screen capture of the files
* Commit the image to your code repo as "week1/github_repo.png"
* NOTE: capitalization matters, so use all lower case


### Step 8 - Add Screen Shot of Book

* It is important that you have the textbook "Django for Beginners" to help you
throughout the course.
* Take a picture of the Cover with your phone
* Commit the image to your code repo as "week1/django_book.jpg"
* NOTE: capitalization matters, so use all lower case


### Step 9 - Test Your Git repo

* Go to the [Student Test Page](https://shrinking-world.com/student/bacs350/test)
* Keep working until the page loads without errors
* No need to turn in the homework assignment.   Grades will be determined from
the content of your Github repo.
