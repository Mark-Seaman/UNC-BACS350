### Hammer Scripts Tests
* All tests produce text output
* When each test is run the output is compared against the expected values
* Failing tests are fixed by
    * Fixing the product code
    * Fixing the test code
    * Approve the current output


### Tests Use the Entire System
* Tests can look at 
    * Database records
    * Files
    * Call up other computers
    * Execute Scripts within Django context
    * Consume web pages
    * Use Git to do version control


### Requirements for a Test
* Use normal operation of system
* Don't interfere with data state
* Produce test that shows proper operation
* 1 minute to write, 15 seconds to fix
* Runs in less than one second


### Expected answer
* Every test produces output
* Run the test and approve the result
* If anything changes the test will fail
* Start with tests that are noisy and fragile
* Approve is the only action needed


### Show the Diff
* Use Linux "diff" command to show unexpected results
* Shows lines removed and added


### Build an App to Manage Tests
* Automatically scan "test" app and builds test objects
* Runs all tests
* Collects and displays test results
* Allow easy approval



## BUILD
