### Course Content
* [Course Content](/course/bacs350/docs/Course)


### Today
* Import Design Pattern
* Export Design Pattern


### Design Patterns
* Capture design decisions for next time
* Reuse design choices
* Custom choices and limitations
* When to apply pattern
* Say it in code


### Reusable Design Patterns
* CRUD Operations
* CRUD Test
* Data Views
* Data Views Test
* Import/Export
* Code Cloner


### Export Design Pattern
* List all records 
* Create a spreadsheet file (CSV)


### Writing CSV File

table/table.py

```python
from csv import writer
from os.path import exists, isdir, dirname

def write_csv_file(path, table):
    assert(exists(dirname(path)))
    with open(path, 'w', newline='') as f:
        writer(f).writerows(table)
```


### Data Model Export Method

book/models.py

```python
class Chapter(models.Model):
    book = models.ForeignKey(Book, on_delete=models.CASCADE, editable=False)
    order = models.IntegerField()
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    def export_record(self):
        return [self.order, self.title]
```


### Import Design Pattern
* Bring data in from a spreadsheet
* For each row create an object
* Read document files


### Reading a Table

table/table.py

```python
from csv import reader, writer
from os.path import exists

def read_csv_file(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        return [row for row in reader(f)]
```


### Data Model Import Method

book/models.py

```python
class Chapter(models.Model):
    book = models.ForeignKey(Book, on_delete=models.CASCADE, editable=False)
    order = models.IntegerField()
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    @staticmethod
    def import_record(book, values):
        c = Chapter.objects.get_or_create(book=book, order=values[0])[0]
        c.title = values[1]
        c.document = values[2]
        c.save()
```


### Importing Objects

book/book.py

```python
def import_chapters(book):
    model = Chapter
    chapters = f'{book.doc_path}/chapters.csv'
    for row in read_csv_file(chapters):
        model.import_record(book, row)
```
