### Data Versioning Design Pattern
* Why use this pattern
* When to use code cloning
* How to steps
* What to focus on


### Why - Data Versioning
* Extract key information from database
* Use Git to track changes
* Review textual change periodically
* Restore objects with Import
* Automatic export nightly


### When - Data Versioning
* Big picture can easily be captured in a table
* Import and export can be safely used


### How - Data Versioning

* Commit data changes
* Object Record Creation
* Import Design Pattern
* Testability


### What - Data Versioning
* Customizations
* Limitations
