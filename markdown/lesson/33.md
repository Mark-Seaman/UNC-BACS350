### Code For Image Upload
Django model ImageField is used to upload images

book/models.py

```python
class Image(models.Model):
    image = models.ImageField(null=True, blank=True, upload_to="images/")
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
```


### Settings for Storage
Set upload directory and URL

```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "media"
```


### Generate Code for Image
* Run the code cloner to produce image files.
* Delete views and templates for Detail and Edit


### Form For Image Upload
Django model ImageField is used to upload images

templates/image_add.html

```html
<form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">

    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Save Record</button>
</form>
```


### Views For Image Upload

book/views_image.py

```python
class ImageListView(ListView):
    template_name = 'image_list.html'
    model = Image

class ImageCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):
    template_name = "image_add.html"
    model = Image
    fields = ['image', 'title']

class ImageDeleteView(LoginRequiredMixin, DeleteView):
    model = Image
    template_name = 'image_delete.html'
    success_url = reverse_lazy('image_list')
```
