### Today
* Page Probe Test Design Patterns


### Catalog of Design Patterns
* [Design Patterns](/course/bacs350/docs/DesignPatterns)
* Use this catalog of patterns as you work on projects
* [Django Tests](../docs/DjangoTests)


### Shrinking World Testing
* Django Tests - Unit tests with test database
* Page Probe Tests - Fetch and examine web pages from local and remote servers
* Hammer Script Tests - Live local and remote servers


### Django Tests 
- Unit tests with test database
* Tests isolated components
* Does not change production data


### Page Probe Tests
* Fetch and examine web pages from local and remote servers
* Use "requests" module in Python to fetch pages
* Use an app to manage test cases

```python
def execute_probe(probe):
    try:
        response = get(probe.page)
    except:
        response = None
    if not response:
        status = f'Status Code: Domain not found,  {probe.page}'
        passed = False
    elif response.status_code != 200:
        status = f'Status Code: {response.status_code}'
        passed = False
    elif probe.text not in response.text:
        status = f'Text not found: {probe.text}'
        passed = False
    else:
        status = f'Matched: {probe.text}'
        passed = True
    Result.create(probe=probe, output=status, passed=passed)
```


### Hammer Script Tests
* Live local and remote servers
* Used to test  and 
    * Complete server with command scripts
    * Local file environment



## BUILD

### Practice
* Clone my repo and study the code in 
[Page Probe Source Code](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350/tree/main/week14/PageProbe)
* Build the code and experiment with it
* Set up tests for your favorite web sites
* Do it simple; do it now!
