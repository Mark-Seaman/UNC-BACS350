## LEARN

### Today
* Refactoring
* Test-driven changes
* Convert to ForeignKey


### Django for Beginners - Chapter 15 
- Comments on Articles
- Articles app
- URL, Templates, Views

### Refactoring
* All code naturally decays
* Refactoring is needed to improve the structure while preserving functionality
* Design after the code is written


### Martin Fowler
* [Refactoring - Martin Fowler](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Technology-ebook-dp-B007WTFWJ6/dp/B007WTFWJ6)
* Defines why, when, and how to refactor


### Why
* Incrementally improve code structure
* Preserve the usefulness of the code
* Protect the investment
* Refactoring is the single most important skill


### When
* In preparation of new features
* When it gets hard
* After the features work


### How
* Automated test rule - Test it or take it out
* Find duplicate code and dead code
* Remove it
* Test-driven development
* Test, Fix, Enhance, Improve (refactor)


### Tests
* Do not refactor without tests
* Let the tests guide you
* Spot check with manual testing



## BUILD

* Improvements
    * Simplify and refactor


### Demo Code
* [Demo Code](https://github.com/Mark-Seaman/BACS350/tree/main/week10/BookBuilder)
* Follow along with my source code
* Clone my repo and edit the code


### Author Data Model
Create a representation for Authors

```python
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```


### Book Data Model
Create a representation for Chapters in the Book

```python
class Book(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
```


### Chapter Data Model
Create a representation for Chapters in the Book

```python
class Chapter(models.Model):
    book = models.ForeignKey(Book, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    order = models.IntegerField()
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
```


### Author's Books
List the Book by an Author

book/views.py

```python
# urls.py
# path('author/<int:pk>',           AuthorDetailView.as_view(),  name='author_detail'),


class AuthorDetailView(DetailView):
    template_name = 'author_detail.html'
    model = Author

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        author = Author.objects.get(pk=self.kwargs['pk'])
        return dict(object=author, books=Book.objects.filter(author=author))

```
