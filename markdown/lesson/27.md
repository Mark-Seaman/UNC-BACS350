### Relational Data
* Data table point to each other
* Objects live in the tables
* Reduce the duplicate information
* Databases are joined by a query


### Foreign Key
* Points to a record in another table
* Saves to ID of the record
* Guarantees that data is consistent
* Data duplication is removed


### Relational Example
* Chapters belong to a Book
* Chapter Data Record
    * book  (points to a book ID)
    * order
    * title


### Chapter Data Model
Create a representation for Chapters in the Book

```python
class Chapter(models.Model):
    book = models.ForeignKey(Book, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    order = models.IntegerField()
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    markdown = models.TextField()
    html = models.TextField()
    document = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    # Bad
    book = models.CharField(max_length=200)
```

### Superhero News
* Superhero Record
    * name
    * identity
    * description
    * strength
    * weakness
    * image

* Article Record
    * hero   (ID of Hero)
    * order
    * title
    * markdown
    * html

```python
class Article(models.Model):
    hero = models.ForeignKey(Hero, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    order = models.IntegerField()
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    markdown = models.TextField()
    html = models.TextField()
```

### Custom Queries in List View
* Find only matching objects
* Pass reference object by ID on URL
* Use get_queryset to filter objects



### Django for Beginners - Chapter 15 
- Comments on Articles
- Articles app
- URL, Templates, Views
- ForeignKey - Comment, Article

## BUILD

### Book Builder Demo

- Add Author Data Type
- Chapter point to Book
- Books point to Authors
- Author <-- Book <-- Chapter
- Views support proper queries
- Book builder style
- Tests for Data/Views (Author, Book, Chapter)


### Limitation of Week 9
* App support Books and Chapters
* But they are not integrated
* Massive duplication of data
* Chapters do not actually belong to a book


### Work Needed
* Show Chapters in Book Details page
* Rework URLs to display chapters
* Rework URLs to edit chapters


### Chapters in Book
List the Chapters in the Book

book/views.py

```python
# urls.py
# path('book/<int:pk>',           BookDetailView.as_view(),  name='book_detail'),


class BookDetailView(DetailView):
    template_name = 'book_detail.html'
    model = Book

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        book = Book.objects.get(pk=self.kwargs['pk'])
        return dict(object=book, chapters=Chapter.objects.filter(book=book.title))

```


### Chapters in Book
Show the Chapters in the Book in detail view

templates/book_detail.html

```html
<table class="table table-hover">
    {% for chapter in chapters %}
    <tr>
        <td>{{ chapter.book }}</td>
        <td><a href="/chapter/{{ chapter.pk }}">Chapter {{ chapter.order }} - {{ chapter.title }}</a></td>
        <td><a href="/chapter/{{ chapter.pk }}/">Edit</a></td>
        <td><a href="/chapter/{{ chapter.pk }}/delete">Delete</a></td>
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</table>
```
